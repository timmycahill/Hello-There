Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed:

Once you have Tomcat set up, you can clone the current repo to your device using the following git command:
* `git clone https://github.com/timmycahill/Hello-There.git`

Once you have cloned the repository, you are ready to start up your Tomcat server. To do this, navigate to `C:\apache-tomcat-8.5.60\bin` and run the `startup.bat` file.
With Tomcat running, navigate to the `Hello-There/Project2Server/target/` folder, copy the `Project2Server.war` file, and paste it in the `C:\apache-tomcat-8.5.60\webapps` folder. After a few seconds, you should see a folder named Project2Server appear in the `C:\apache-tomcat-8.5.60\webapps` folder. Your application is now on the server and ready to be accessed.

To access the application, open up your browser and type `localhost:8080` into the address bar.
